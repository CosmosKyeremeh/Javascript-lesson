   <h1> function <!--function creates a block of that can be reused anytime wherever called --></h1> 

   <p>
    1. the word function creates a new function followed by function name. --- function functionName 
    2. the rules for function naming is same as variable naming; *can't use special words. *can't start with a number eg: 123functionName(). * special characters are not allowed except for '$' and '_'. *the best practice is to use camelCase in naming. 
    3. full demo of ffunction
        function functionName() { -funtion body- }

        the function body holds all you'd want the funtion to do.

        NB: function only creates a function, it doesn't run the code. To run the code you have call the function with bracket, like functionName();.

        the  importance of function is that
        it helps create reuseable code which can be called anywhere in the code, this way debug is rendered easily.

        Return statement
      Return statement is one important feature of function as it helps get a value out of a funtion.
